# Rotarod

## Necessary Items

1\. Rotarod apparatus.\
2. Damp cloth and neutral soap.\
3. One transport cage with bedding.\
4. A stopwatch.

## Operating the Machine

1\. Connect the power cable in the back of the machine.\
2. Turn on the "ON" switch in the back of the machine.\
3. Ensure all levers are lowered.\
4. Select the desired working mode.

### Changing Sensitivity of the Levers

To make the levers *more sensitive* to falls, tighten the screw on the lever clockwise.\\ To make the levers *less sensitive* to falls, loosen the screw on the lever counterclockwise.\

## Protocols

### [Training Protocol]{style="color:orange"}

Animals should be acclimated to the room for \~10-30 minutes.

1\. Select [constant]{style="color:fuchsia"} mode.\
2. Select th rotation speed by pressing the +/- buttons. The rod will not start rotating until "Start" is pressed. *This value should be set at 5 rpm*.\
3. Press "Start" to start the rotation.\
4. Place the animals on the rod.\
5. Lift the levers for the lanes that will be used in the trial.\
6. Training trials last for 60 seconds.\
7. Animals should be placed in the transport cage upon fall. Do not return animals to their home cage until all animals from the same cage have completed the trial.\

[NOTE]{style="color:orange"}: Rotation speed can be changed during the trial by pressing the +/- buttons.\

### [Experimental Protocol]{style="color:orange"}

Animals should be acclimated to the room for \~10-30 minutes.\
1\. Select [acceleration]{style="color:fuchsia"} mode.\
2. Select "Ramp Time" to indicate how long the rod will take to reach the maximum speed. Acceleration speed is automatically calculated. *This value should be set at 5 minutes.*\
3. Press "Start" to initiate the rotation at 4rpm (constant).\
4. Place the animals on the rod. 5. Lift the levers for the lanes that will be used in the trial.\
6. Press "Hold Ramp" to start the acceleration.\
7. The device enters the "Stop State" once the last lever is lowered following the fall of the last animal.\
8. Animals should be placed in the transport cage upon fall. Do not return animals to their home cage until all animals from the same cage have completed the trial.\
9. Animals should be given a 10-15 minute rest period between trials.\

## Variables measured
1\. Rotation speed at the moment of the fall.\
2. Time spent on the rod.\

## Mouse placement

1\. Turn on the cylinder so that mice has to grip and move as soon as they are placed on the device.
2. Holding the animal from its tail, swing them up from a position lower than the rod.

## Cleanup

Clean the apparatus with a damp cloth and a squiggle of neutral soap to remove odor, urine, and feces.\
The equipment DOES NOT need to be disinfected after use. Do not rinse the equipment nor pour liquids on it.\


# Wire Hang Test

## Necessary Items
1\. Wire Hang Apparatus.\
2. Quatricide and paper towels.\
3. Several handfuls of bedding material or cotton wool.\
4. A stopwatch.\
5. Up to 6 transport cages with bedding.\

## Operating the Machine
1\. Ensure the wire mesh is facing upwards.
2. Ensure the drawer can slide in and out of the apparatus.\
3. Pad the bottom of the drawer with a dense layer of soft bedding material like cotton wool or bedding.\
4. Ensure the canopy is securely in place and it's able to flip over seamlessly.

## Protocol

Animals should be acclimated to the room for \~10 minutes.

1\. Place the mouse on the canopy.\
2. Invert the canopy so that the animal is hanging from the wire mesh.\
3. Record the time it takes for the animal to fall.\
4. *Animals will be left hanging for 3 minutes or until they fall.*\
5. Place the animal in an empty transport cage upon fall. Monitor for signs of distress or injury.\
6. After 1 minute, the animal should be placed back on the device for the second trial.
7. Place the animal in an empty transport cage upon fall. Monitor for signs of distress or injury.\
8. After 1 minute, the animal should be placed back on the device for the third trial.
9. Place the animal in an empty transport cage upon fall. Monitor for signs of distress or injury.\
10. After 1 minute, return the animals from the transport cage to their respective home cage.\

[NOTE]{style="color:orange"}: Animals unable to recover should be euthanized.

## Variables measured
1\. Time to fall.\

## Cleanup
Discard the bedding, then sanitize the bottom of the apparatus with quatricide and paper towels after each mouse is done with all 3 trials for the day.\
